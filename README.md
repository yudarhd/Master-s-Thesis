# Master-s-Thesis

Hi everyone,

I Would like to share my programming of my final project to get a Master of Science on Advanced Astrophysics from Institut Teknologi Bandung. That is about "The Utilization of Bayesian Framework in Determining Projected Spatial Distributions of Star Clusters".

The aims of that:

1. Modeling various spatial density distributions of globular and open clusters using Bayesian Evidence (Marginal Likelihood).
2. Calculating the posterior model ratio (Bayes factor) using a Bayesian Framework and determine the best model of spatial density distribution the Globular and Open Clusters.
3. Determine the total mass and predict the mass segregation of Globular and Open Clusters.

Happy Coding!
